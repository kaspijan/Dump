These are extra-curricular assignment from Quantum Mechanics (http://www.pmf.unizg.hr/phy/predmet/kvafiz_a).

Goal of most assignment is to provide the solution to a quantum problem in analitical form (these calculations are not provided here), 
then use Python to finish the analitical solution, and also use numerical calculations in Python to check the solutions. Parts of the assignment were also to plot 
certain aspects of the problem (wave function, energies, barriers, etc.)
