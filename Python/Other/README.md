Folder for other Python project.

One is a Fourier decomposition of a linear function.

The other is a board from the tv-quiz Potjera coded in Python, to be used for playing at home. It is ment to be connected with Arduino (via serial connection or Wi-Fi) which controls the button input, however, that part of the code needs more work. Never the less, the board is operational without the button input.
