Exercises from Duboko uƒçenje 1 (http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~ssegvic/du/).

5 exercies, most of the code was written by me. Some parts of the code were given by the professor (like data sampling or plotting).
In comments through-out the code is written which parts is my code and which was supplied before-hand (by FER).
